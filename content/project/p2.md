* Aiming to create an application to authenticate users based on keystroke dynamics, on their devices, in real-time. It will adapt for any future changes in the typing patterns of users as well. Will also address privacy concerns.
* Thus typing patterns will act as Biometrics for vulnerable devices. Also aiming to publish a research paper on this.
