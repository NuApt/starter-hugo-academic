Ever thought of an Idea that you can harness some Energy when you feel jerks while Travelling in a vehicle!!!
Exactly, we worked upon this great concept and made a Working Damper and simulated it on real-time typical Indian Road using MATLAB Simulink. We were able to achieve almost 70% Efficient System.
